This is a FastTrack plugin for giFT (www.giftproject.org)
...just in case you haven't guessed.

Obviosuly I take no responsibility as to what this code does to
your hardware, data, physical or mental health.

Then again, running KaZaA in wine may destroy all of the above.


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

run ./autogen.sh and this will run automake and friends, then configure.

Mac OS X users should run sh -c 'LIBTOOL=glibtool LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./autogen.sh'
(or if use fink to install it, if you have it)

All that is left to do is run make



There is currently one configure option, --disable-ltdl, if you do not
want to build libtool libs.

Most of the plugin code was taken from OpenFT and old giFT code and
as such is copyrighted by the gift project.

Thanks to weinholt for reverse engineering most parts of enc_type_1.c

enc_type_2.c is the work of Raimar Falke, I merely cleaned it up a bit.
