---------------------

This is a FastTrack plugin for giFT (www.giftproject.org)
...just in case you haven't guessed.

Obviosuly we take no responsibility as to what this code does to
your hardware, software, physical or mental health.

Then again, running KaZaA in wine may destroy all of the above.


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

First put the sources you got somewhere outside the giFT source tree
(note: this is contrary to previous versions of the plugin).

Needed tools to build giFT-Fastrack are as follows:

automake    >= 1.5
autoconf    >= 2.5
libtool     >= 1.4
pkg-config
giFT
ltdl        (for now it is required)

Then run './autogen.sh' in the top source dir.

Mac OS X users should run sh -c 'LIBTOOL=glibtool LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./autogen.sh'
(or if use fink to install it, if you have it)

If you have giFT installed in a non-standard location (according to pkg-config),
you must make sure that PKG_CONFIG_PATH is set to the directory where libgift.pc
is located.

For example:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" (for bash)
or
  setenv PKG_CONFIG_PATH "/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig" (for tcsh)


The next step is to run 'make' and 'make install' which will compile
and install the plugin.

Then add FastTrack to the [main]/plugins line in ~/.giFT/gift.conf,
like so:

old:
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella

new:
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella:FastTrack

You may also use a fully qualified path to the plugin filename:
 
	[main]
	plugins = OpenFT:/usr/local/lib/giFT/libFastTrack.la
 
The plugin will copy the configuration files from the
$PREFIX/share/giFT/FastTrack/ directory if necessary.



There is currently one configure option, --disable-ltdl, if you do not
want to build libtool libs (*.la). (but non-ltdl builds are currently
broken)


Common Problems
---------------

As a general rule, if you get errors that aren't mentioned below, first get
fresh sources from cvs before trying anything else. It may be that something
about giFT has changed and we fixed it in cvs but haven't released yet.

Problem:  You put the plugin into the giFT source tree.
Symptoms: During ./autogen.sh you get the error:
          "libtoolize failed to generate ltmain.sh"
Solution: Move the plugin somewhere outside the giFT source tree, or update
	  to the newest cvs version.


Problem:  You do not have ltdl libs installed.
Symptoms: during make you get the error:
	  libtool: link: cannot find the library `../../src/libFastTrack.la'
Solution: install ltdl (apt-get install libltdl3-dev in debian) and remove
	  config.cache, then rerun autogen.sh


Problem:  giFT was not built with ltdl support
Symptoms: *** GIFT-FATAL: couldn't load protocol /usr/lib/giFT/libFastTrack.la
	  in file : binary does not support this protocol, consider ltdl support
Solution: Make sure libltdl is installed (see previous problem) and
	  rm config.cache && ./autogen.sh

Credits

Most of the plugin code was taken from OpenFT and old giFT code and
as such is copyrighted by the gift project.

Thanks to weinholt for reverse engineering most parts of enc_type_1.c

enc_type_2.c is the work of Raimar Falke, I merely cleaned it up a bit.
