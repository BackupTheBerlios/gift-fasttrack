---------------------

This is a FastTrack plugin for giFT (www.giftproject.org)
...just in case you haven't guessed.

Obviosuly we take no responsibility as to what this code does to
your hardware, software, physical or mental health.

Then again, running KaZaA in wine may destroy all of the above.


Compilation & Installation
--------------------------

First put the sources you got somewhere outside the giFT source tree
(note: this is contrary to previous versions of the plugin).

Then run './autogen.sh' in the top source dir.

Mac OS X users should run sh -c 'LIBTOOL=glibtool LIBTOOLIZE=glibtoolize ./autogen.sh'
(or if use fink to install it, if you have it)

The next step is to run 'make' and 'make install' which will compile
and install the plugin.

Finally add 'FastTrack' to your gift.conf file like so:

old: 'plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella'
new: 'plugins = OpenFT:Gnutella:FastTrack'


There is currently one configure option, --disable-ltdl, if you do not
want to build libtool libs.


Common Problems
---------------

As a general rule, if you get errors that aren't mentioned below, first get
fresh sources from cvs before trying anything else. It may be that something
about giFT has changed and we fixed it in cvs but haven't released yet.

Problem:  You're using an outdated version of automake.
Symptoms: During ./autogen.sh you get errors like:
          "automake: src/Makefile.am: not supported: source file `crypt/fst_crypt.c' is in subdirectory"
Solution: Update to automake 1.5 or higher.
          For example, on Debian do a 'apt-get intsall automake1.5'

Problem:  You put the plugin into the giFT source tree.
Symptoms: During ./autogen.sh you get the error:
          "libtoolize failed to generate ltmain.sh"
Solution: Move the plugin somewhere outside the giFT source tree.

Most of the plugin code was taken from OpenFT and old giFT code and
as such is copyrighted by the gift project.

Thanks to weinholt for reverse engineering most parts of enc_type_1.c

enc_type_2.c is the work of Raimar Falke, I merely cleaned it up a bit.
